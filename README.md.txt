Branch One
Things I have learnt used git through the commandline:
1)I initialized a git repo on my local system, called it sarah-git-pratice.
2)I used my terminal to navigate to the repo(sarah-git-pratice)
(cd git desktop------enter)
(cd git sarah-git-pratice) 
3)I created a README.md file, and inserted the text Branch One in it.
4)I commited the changes done in my README.md file.
5)I created a branch(branch-one)
(git branch branch-one)
6)I switched to branch-one.
(git checkout branch-one)
7)I committed the changes made in branch-one.
(git add branch-one)
(git commit -m "my first branch")
8)I edited the README.md file and wrote things i learnt using git through the terminal.
9)I committed the changes done in the README.md file.
10)I created a branch branch-two.
(git branch branch-two)
11)I switched to branch-two.
(git checkout branch-two)
12)I pushed the file to my github account.
(remote add origin https://github.com/sarahokenwa/sarah-git-pratice.git)
(push origin branch-two)
